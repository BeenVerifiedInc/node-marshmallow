Marshmallow
-----------

A small campfire bot-builder made with node.js

    var marshmallow = require("marshmallow").marshmallow;

    var config = {
      token:   process.env["CAMPFIRE_TOKEN"],
      account: process.env["CAMPFIRE_ACCOUNT"],
      ssl:     process.env["CAMPFIRE_SSL"] == "true",
      room_id: process.env["CAMPFIRE_ROOM"]
    };

    var GitHub = "http://github.com/secret/awesomeness";

    marshmallow(config, function(bot) {
      bot.on("!review (\S+)", function(branch) {
        this.speak([GitHub, "compare", branch].join("/"));
      });
    });

This will listen to all messages on the specified campfire room, and whenever a
message matches one of the defined regular expressions, the corresponding
callback will be invoked, passing any captures from the regular expression as
arguments.

This is an example conversation from our campfire room:

    Developer A: guys, when you have some time, please !review my_feature_branch
    Mr Robot: http://github.com/secret/awesomeness/compare/my_feature_branch
    Developer B: sweet, reading the diff

This is useful for all sorts of small things, like "take a look at !ticket ##",
or that sort of thing.

Let me know if you're using it and what for! I'm glad to add examples to it :)

Sidenote
========

This is my frist node.js project. Please do let me know if the code is awful and
how it can be improved. My email is on my github profile :)
